## Sales Process:

### Prospecting/Lead Generation/Intelligent Outreach
Here we are building awareness and relying on some of our digital tools to create a database of interest. These are:
- Facebook lead gen forms (*Todo*)
- Website email sign-up
- Social channel DM’s (*Todo - requires CRM*)
- Zendesk chat (*Todo*)
- Landing pages (*Todo*)

For each of these we want to understand who the person is:
- First and last name
- City, State, Country
- Contact information (email)
- What are they interested in? Communiting, Green Mobility, etc?

> Duane anything else for this demographic/interests part?

This should be feeding into a CRM tool where inside sales/customer service or outside reps can search to understand where in the buyer journey the customer is.

### Qualifying/Building the Trigger
At this point we are understanding what they are after, is it a new Veemo, after sales support?
Creating a flow-chart model will guide the sales agent what the next action item should be, potentials are:
- Ideal timing to purchase
- Any potential barriers to purchase
- Flow-chart model (*Todo*)

All of this information is added to the CRM tool and the customer is tagged and agent assigned.

### Value Proposition
Here we are creating the interest and guiding to potential value propositions based on customer timing
- Example: wants the best price on a Veemo, but is looking to purchase in 6-9 months, we highlight clear out/demo/refurbished product and/or financing incentives

Objections are handled, again highlighting common barriers with solutions such as consumer financing, trade-up programs, etc.
- Highlight value in going green
- Ease of commute (moving through traffic)
- Smaller carbon footprint
- Warranty

### Evaluation/Closing in on consumer intent
We’ve highlighted the value proposition and dealt with the objections, what’s left:
- Ask for the sale
- Highlight social proof (personal experience, media/PR wins) reinforcing the purchase decision.

### Support
If the customer purchased:
- Automated follow-up, is everything like they expected, helpful hints in setting up the Veemo
- Early ride shake down and pre and post ride bolt checks
- Short and long term maintenance guidelines

If they didn’t purchase:
- Any barrier that we missed?
- How can we get you rolling?
- Roll back to steps 2 and 3

## Goal Setting:

Once we start to develop a level of historical sales data, we will utilize the data to create sales forests as well as individual and team based sales goals. These goals should be inline with necessary revenue projections and cash flow models. These goals will be used to create a standard of performance for each sales agent. Weekly, monthly and quarterly reviews help keep revenue goals on track as well as providing early insight into what’s not working and where we may need to provide additional support.
